- **Transformer Architecture**: GPT like model with causal self attention
- **Multi-Device Support**: CUDA (Nvidia), MPS (Apple Silicon), and CPU
- **Lazy Dataset Loading**: Memory efficient training on large code corpus
- **Code Completion**: Generate Python code completions

psutil
```

I have trained a Python model and a C++ model on my friend's GPU with this, and it was fast and good enough for finishing obvious code snippets.

This is for a hackathon thing.
